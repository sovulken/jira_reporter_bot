# JIRA reporter VK bot

NOTE1: WIP, to be improved

NOTE2: this thing is actually for educational use only written in educational purpose in mind. I am C++ developer and now keep on going to church twice a week as programming in PHP considered deadly sin in my opinion.

## Functionality description

Bot asks you on daily basis using your local time (CEST/CET by default) to fill JIRA tempo report based on your answer. You can reply with:
- JIRA case number and optional description,
- some general description (would be persisted as some common case for tracking this).

## Why do I even need this

Lucky enough outside Russia VK is not banned by some common secure firewalls, so, probably you can use it in background to reply
